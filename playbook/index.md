# One Million Developers 2020 Playbook

Joe Lubin ushedered in the Era of The Ethereum Developer by announcing a challenge to grow the Ethereum network to One Million Developers.

Support 1,000,000+ developers in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The One Million Devs vision is large.

It will take a village.

Together.

Many ways exist to organize an Open Source project and campaign. It can be privately funded. Organized via grassroots. Or a combination of both. Because it can be difficult to understand how to contribute to a decentralzied project, the One Million Developers stewards will do our best to outline a simple playbook that everyone can follow along to get involved.

We want You to join the One Million Developers initiative. And we want it to be easy, fun and rewarding.

## ðŸš§Warning - DRAFT MODE ðŸš§

The Stewards are actively drafting the OMD 2020 Playbook. We want to do it in the open. But it might wildly change and adapt based on input and recommendations.

# Process/Playbook Overview

- Organizing People & Teams
- One Million Developers Improvement Proposals
- Proposal Approval & Rejection Process
- Assign Roles and Responsibilities
- Secure Funding & Resources for Approved Proposals

# Organizing People & Teams

The first order of business is creating the proper structure accomodate contributions and growth from a global developer community. The One Million Developers is being currently being stewardard by members of the ConsenSys Mesh. However, it shouldn't only be a ConsenSys project.

This is a formal invitation to get involved. To provide feedback, input, code, opinions and contributions.

Ask not you 1MD can do for you, but rather what can You do for 1MD!

# One Million Developers Improvement Proposals

To create an open and fair process the One Million Developers have decided to include a Proposal process. The OMDIP provide a way for anyone, and everyone to get involved.

Think we can do something better? Propose a solution! How long it will take. And an estimate of how much value it adds to the One Million Developers initiative.

# Proposal Approval & Rejection Process

Currently the One Million Developers has an informal decision making process. In the future we might include a formal process for approving proposals, but for now the best we can do is an informal and transparent process.

# Assign Roles and Responsibilities

Approved proposals will (hopefully) have a budget and attached bounties, which will incentivize contributors to pick tasks and responsibilities best suited for them.

# Secure Funding & Resources for Approved Proposals

Finally, the Stewards will need to continue to find funding sources for succesful projects. One Million Develoeprs will require one million jobs.
